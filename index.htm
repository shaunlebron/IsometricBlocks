	<h1>Drawing isometric boxes in the correct order</h1>

	<p>
In an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_projection">isometric</a>
display, it can be tricky to draw boxes of various sizes in the correct order
to keep them appropriately in front of or behind one another.  The figure below
shows an example.  The blue box should be drawn first, then green, then red.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id='figure1a' width=350 height=200></canvas>
		<canvas id='figure1b' width=350 height=200></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 1: The boxes on the left are <u>not</u> drawn in the correct order, whereas the
boxes on the right are drawn correctly.
		</figcaption>
		<script>
			var blocks = [
				new IsoBlock.Block({x:1,y:3,z:0},{x:2,y:2,z:2.5}, IsoBlock.colors.green),
				new IsoBlock.Block({x:2,y:2,z:0},{x:1,y:1,z:1.5}, IsoBlock.colors.red),
				new IsoBlock.Block({x:3,y:1,z:0},{x:1,y:4,z:1},   IsoBlock.colors.blue),
			];
			IsoBlock.makeFigure({ canvas:'figure1a', blocks: blocks, sortBlocks: false, });
			IsoBlock.makeFigure({ canvas:'figure1b', blocks: blocks, });
		</script>
	</figure>

	<p>
We will explore a simple solution for determining the correct order to draw a
given set of boxes.  But first, we must define what we mean by <em>boxes</em>.
	</p>

	<h3>What do we mean by <em>boxes</em>?</h3>

	<p>
We define boxes as <em>axis-aligned</em> and <em>non-intersecting</em>
rectangular prisms. Take a look at the above Figure 1 again.  Each box is
parallel to the <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em> axis (i.e.
axis-aligned).  Also, note that the boxes are next to each other but do not
intersect.
	</p>

	<h3>Determine if boxes overlap on screen.</h3>

	<p>
First of all, if two boxes do not overlap on the screen, then we do not have to
worry about which one is drawn first.  This is the first test we must perform,
which we explore in this section.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id='figure2a' width=350 height=200></canvas>
		<canvas id='figure2b' width=350 height=200></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 2: No overlap on the left; overlap on the right.  (Note: we are talking
about overlap on screen, not intersection in space.)
		</figcaption>
		<script>
			var rightBlock =   new IsoBlock.Block({x:4,y:1,z:0},{x:2,y:2,z:2}, IsoBlock.colors.blue);
			var leftBlock =  new IsoBlock.Block({x:2,y:4,z:0},{x:2.25,y:2,z:1}, IsoBlock.colors.red);
			var rightBlockOverlap =   new IsoBlock.Block({x:3,y:2,z:0},{x:2,y:2,z:2}, IsoBlock.colors.blue);
			var leftBlockOverlap =  new IsoBlock.Block({x:2,y:4,z:0},{x:2.25,y:2,z:1}, IsoBlock.colors.green);
			var scale = function(w,h) { return h/9;};
			IsoBlock.makeFigure({ canvas:'figure2a',
				blocks: [ leftBlock, rightBlock ],
				scale: scale,
			});
			IsoBlock.makeFigure({ canvas:'figure2b',
				blocks: [ leftBlockOverlap, rightBlockOverlap ],
				scale: scale,
			});
		</script>
	</figure>

	<p>
The silhouettes of the 3D boxes become 2D hexagons in the isometric view, as seen below.  We use the
outline of these silhouettes to test for overlap.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id='figure3a' width=350 height=200></canvas>
		<canvas id='figure3b' width=350 height=200></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 3: The box silhouettes in an isometric view are simple hexagons.  Note
that their sides are always parallel to the vertical and two diagonal axes.
		</figcaption>
		<script>
			IsoBlock.makeFigure({ canvas:'figure3a',
				blocks: [ leftBlock, rightBlock ],
				scale: scale,
				silhouette: true,
			});
			IsoBlock.makeFigure({ canvas:'figure3b',
				blocks: [ leftBlockOverlap, rightBlockOverlap ],
				scale: scale,
				silhouette: true,
			});
		</script>
	</figure>

	<p>
We take advantage of the fact that the hexagon sides are always parallel to
some axis.  This allows us to easily determine if the hexagons overlap by
checking for intersection of their regions on each axis.  We add an <em>h</em>
(horizontal) axis to help.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id='figure4a' width=350 height=200></canvas>
		<canvas id='figure4b' width=350 height=200></canvas>
		<figcaption>
The red and blue boxes do not overlap on the h axis, therefore they do not overlap.
The green and blue boxes do overlap since their region on every axis overlap.
		</figcaption>
		<script>
			IsoBlock.makeFigure({ canvas:'figure4a',
				blocks: [ leftBlock, rightBlock ],
				drawAxis: true,
				silhouette: true,
				scale: scale,
			});
			IsoBlock.makeFigure({ canvas:'figure4b',
				blocks: [ leftBlockOverlap, rightBlockOverlap ],
				drawAxis: true,
				silhouette: true,
				scale: scale,
			});
		</script>
	</figure>

	<p>
Now that we have outlined our concept for <em>determining if two boxes overlap
on the screen</em>, we will fill in the details necessary for implementing it.
	</p>

	<p>
The act of flattening the 3D box into a 2D hexagon involves getting rid of the
Z coordinate.  Notice that increasing a point's Z coordinate by 1 is the same
as incrementing both X and Y coordinates by 1.  Thus, we can add Z to both X
and Y and drop Z completely.  Shown below is the source code for a function
that performs this conversion.
	</p>

<code class='block'><span class="Comment">// Convert a 3D space position to a 2D isometric position.</span>
<span class="Identifier">function</span> spaceToIso(spacePos) <span class="Identifier">{</span>

    <span class="Comment">// New XY position simply adds Z to X and Y.</span>
    <span class="Identifier">var</span> isoX = spacePos.x + spacePos.z;
    <span class="Identifier">var</span> isoY = spacePos.y + spacePos.z;

    <span class="Statement">return</span> <span class="Identifier">{</span>
        x: isoX,
        y: isoY,

        <span class="Comment">// Compute horizontal distance from origin.</span>
        h: (isoX - isoY) * Math.cos(Math.PI/6),

        <span class="Comment">// Compute vertical distance from origin.</span>
        v: (isoX + isoY) / 2;
    <span class="Identifier">}</span>;
<span class="Identifier">}</span></code>

	<p>
And finally, after determining the bounds of each hexagon, we can determine if
they overlap by using the source code below.
	</p>

<code class='block'><span class="Identifier">function</span> doHexagonsOverlap(hex1, hex2) <span class="Identifier">{</span>
    <span class="Comment">// Hexagons overlap if and only if all axis regions overlap.</span>
    <span class="Statement">return</span> (

        <span class="Comment">// test if x regions intersect.</span>
        !(hex1.xmin &gt;= hex2.xmax || hex2.xmin &gt;= hex1.xmax) &amp;&amp;

        <span class="Comment">// test if y regions intersect.</span>
        !(hex1.ymin &gt;= hex2.ymax || hex2.ymin &gt;= hex1.ymax) &amp;&amp;

        <span class="Comment">// test if h regions intersect.</span>
        !(hex1.hmin &gt;= hex2.hmax || hex2.hmin &gt;= hex1.hmax));
<span class="Identifier">}</span></code>

	<p>
Now that we have determined if two boxes overlap on the screen, we can begin exploring how to determine which box is in front of the other.
	</p>

	<h3>Determine which box is in front.</h3>

	<p>
Recall that our boxes do not intersect each other. we can visualize their separation
as a thin plane between them (see Figure 5 below).  After identifying this
plane, we can determine which box is in front by selecting the one on the
correct side of this plane.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id='figure5a' width=230 height=200></canvas>
		<canvas id='figure5b' width=230 height=200></canvas>
		<canvas id='figure5c' width=230 height=200></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 5: A pair of blocks can be separated in one of three ways shown here.
The dark glass illustrates this separation.
		</figcaption>
		<script>
			var refBlock =   new IsoBlock.Block({x:3,y:2,z:0},{x:2,y:2,z:2}, IsoBlock.colors.blue);
			var leftBlock =  new IsoBlock.Block({x:2,y:4,z:0},{x:2.25,y:2,z:1}, IsoBlock.colors.red);
			var topBlock =   new IsoBlock.Block({x:4,y:2,z:2},{x:1.25,y:2,z:1}, IsoBlock.colors.orange);
			var frontBlock = new IsoBlock.Block({x:1,y:1,z:0},{x:2,y:2,z:1}, IsoBlock.colors.green);
			IsoBlock.makeFigure({ canvas:'figure5a', drawPlane: true,
				blocks: [ refBlock, leftBlock ],
			});
			IsoBlock.makeFigure({ canvas:'figure5b', drawPlane: true,
				blocks: [ refBlock, topBlock ],
			});
			IsoBlock.makeFigure({ canvas:'figure5c', drawPlane: true,
				blocks: [ refBlock, frontBlock ],
			});
		</script>
	</figure>

	<p>
We can find this plane of separation by looking at each axis individually.  In
particular, we look for an axis which has non-intersecting box ranges (see
Figure 6 below).
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id='figure6a' width=350 height=200></canvas>
		<canvas id='figure6b' width=350 height=200></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 6: On the left, the blocks are separated on the y-axis.  On the right,
the blocks are separated on the x-axis. (The z-axis is omitted for simplicity.)
		</figcaption>
		<script>
			IsoBlock.makeFigure({ canvas:'figure6a',
				blocks: [ refBlock, leftBlock ],
				drawAxis: true,
			});
			IsoBlock.makeFigure({ canvas:'figure6b',
				blocks: [ refBlock, frontBlock ],
				drawAxis: true,
			});
		</script>
	</figure>

	<p>
In Figure 6 above, we have chosen a coordinate system which make lesser values
of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> to be closer to the camera.  Though not shown, the
<em>z</em> axis is positive in the up direction, so a greater value makes it
closer to the camera.
	</p>

	<p>
The following is a javascript function for determining if the first block is in
front of the second:
	</p>

	<code class='block'><span class="Identifier">function</span> isBoxInFront(box1, box2) <span class="Identifier">{</span>

    <span class="Comment">// test for intersection x-axis</span>
    <span class="Comment">// (lower x value is in front)</span>
    <span class="Statement">if</span> (box1.xmin &gt;= box2.xmax) <span class="Identifier">{</span> <span class="Statement">return</span> <span class="Constant">false</span>; <span class="Identifier">}</span>
    <span class="Statement">else</span> <span class="Statement">if</span> (box2.xmin &gt;= box1.xmax) <span class="Identifier">{</span> <span class="Statement">return</span> <span class="Constant">true</span>; <span class="Identifier">}</span>

    <span class="Statement">else</span> <span class="Statement">if</span> (box2.zmin &gt;= box1.zmax) <span class="Identifier">{</span> <span class="Statement">return</span> <span class="Constant">false</span>; <span class="Identifier">}</span>

<span class="Identifier">}</span></code>

	<h3>Draw boxes in the correct order.</h3>

	<p>
In general, <u>a box should not be drawn until all the ones behind it are
drawn</u>.  Thus, we begin by drawing the boxes that have nothing behind them.
Then, we can draw the boxes that are only in front of those that are already
drawn. This process continues until all boxes are drawn. (See Figure 4 below
for an example.)
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id='figure7' width=650 height=200></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 4: (1) Nothing is behind blue, so draw it first. (2) Draw green next
since blue was the only one behind it and is already drawn.  (3) Then draw red,
since both blocks that were behind it have been drawn.
		</figcaption>
		<script>
			var blocks = [
				new IsoBlock.Block({x:1,y:3,z:0},{x:2,y:2,z:2.5}, IsoBlock.colors.green),
				new IsoBlock.Block({x:2,y:2,z:0},{x:1,y:1,z:1.5}, IsoBlock.colors.red),
				new IsoBlock.Block({x:3,y:1,z:0},{x:1,y:4,z:1},   IsoBlock.colors.blue),
			];
			IsoBlock.makeFigure({ canvas:'figure7', blocks: blocks, scale: function(w,h) { return h/7; }});
		</script>
	</figure>

	<p>
To implement this algorithm, each box must know exactly which boxes are behind
it.  We have already determined how to do this in the last section.  A search
must be implemented so that each box has a list of boxes behind it.
	</p>

	<p>
You are now armed with everything you need to know to render isometric boxes in
the correct order.
	</p>

	<h3>A conundrum</h3>

	<p>
It is possible to have a situation seen in the figure below.  The aforementioned drawing
methods dictate that we first draw the box with nothing behind it, but this example illustrates
a case where this cannot be done.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id='figure8' width=650 height=200></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Here are three boxes intertwined in a way such that one is always behind
another.  This prevents us from drawing a first box.
		</figcaption>
		<script>
		var blocks = [
			new IsoBlock.Block({x:1,y:1,z:0},{x:2,y:1,z:1}, IsoBlock.colors.purple),
			new IsoBlock.Block({x:2,y:1,z:1},{x:1,y:2,z:1}, IsoBlock.colors.red),
			new IsoBlock.Block({x:1,y:2,z:0},{x:1,y:1,z:1}, IsoBlock.colors.orange),
			new IsoBlock.Block({x:1,y:2,z:1},{x:1,y:1,z:1}, IsoBlock.colors.orange),
		];
		IsoBlock.makeFigure({ canvas:'figure8', blocks: blocks, scale: function(w,h) { return h/6;} });
		</script>
	</figure>

	<p>
The figure above cheats by segmenting the orange box into two.
This is one method of breaking this type of cycle.
	</p>

	<p>
There are formal methods used for detecting
such cycles mentioned in the appendix.  After detection of a cycle, the blocks in that cycle
could be drawn with special clipping regions to respect front boxes or to segment a block or blocks
that will break the cycle.  These are solutions that I will be exploring and updating this article as
my experiments progress.
	</p>

	<hr>
	<h2>Appendix</h2>

	<h4>A formal description of the solution</h4>

	<p>
This is a special case of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painter%27s_algorithm">Painter's Algorithm</a>,
which handles occlusion by drawing back-to-front.
	</p>

	<p>
For those who are interested, our method for determining if hexagons and boxes
are overlapping is a result of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane_separation_theorem">hyperplane separation theorem</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
Also, the way in which we determined the drawing order of the boxes is known in graph theory as a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">topological sort</a>,
which is essentially a depth-first search of a directed graph.
	</p>

	<p>
You can build a directed graph of the <em>boxes</em>, with directed edges to
the boxes that are behind it.  Topologically sorting this graph will produce an
ordered list of boxes that can be drawn in that exact order.
	</p>

	<p>
Mathematicians will recognize this directed graph as a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set">partially ordered
set</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
Finally, to prevent the aforementioned cycle conundrum, we can use <a href="">Tarjan's
strongly connection components</a> algorithm.  After computing these cycles,
one could either split a block to prevent a cycle, or to use a clipping region
to prevent drawing over any blocks that are supposed to be in front of it.
	</p>

	<h4>Alternative Solutions</h4>

	<p>
You may be able to just use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-buffering">Z-buffering</a>,
though drawing order is still important for transparent sprites.  Also, if all
bounding boxes are unit cubes, sorting is much simpler.
	</p>

	<h4>Full example of working code</h4>

	<p>
All the diagrams above were created using a simple isometric box renderer
written in Javascript, which applies all the techniques described in this
article.  You can study the fully annotated source code on <a
href="https://github.com/shaunew/IsometricBlocks">IsometricBlocks project on
GitHub</a>.
